                <h1>Vision</h1>
                What Sticks Health (WSH) is a health data storage infrastructure that provides personalized feedback. It is a work in progress. You can visit it at https://what-sticks-health.com to see what is there so far but here is a breakdown of what is going on.
                If you think you can help feel free to reach out.<br/><br/>

                <h2>Existing Platform</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Data Storage: web application that allows users to upload Polar Beat training session, weight and user specified activity ( i.e. drinking coffee, headache, emotion, etc.,)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Feedback: Polar Beat training session indexed to model for cardio health
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Next Steps (Immediate)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Storage: iOS and Android device application (weight and activity) https://github.com/costa-rica/whatSticksKivy01</li>
                    <li>Feedback: build correlations to provide simple feedback â€” similar to the training session heart rate modeling</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Next Steps (Near Future)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encrypted data storage</li>
                    <li>Anonymized data</li>
                    <li>Interoperability to upload and share data</li>
                    <li>Build more in platform feedback</li>
                    <li>Include well established health benchmarks to assist user feedback</li>
                </ul>
